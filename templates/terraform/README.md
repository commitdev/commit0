## Guidelines & Style Convention Summary

- All Terraform configuration should be formatted with `terraform fmt` before being accepted into this repository.
- This repository is Terraform version >= 0.12, as such, leverage features from this release whenever possible.
    See https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html for more information.
- Leverage community-maintained Terraform modules whenever possible.
- Attempt to minimize duplication whenever possible, but only within reason -- sometimes duplication is an acceptable solution.
- Follow style conventions described in `docs/guide.pdf` whenever possible.
- Whenever possible, inject resources down versus referencing resources across modules. This has been made easier with new features in v0.12.
- Whenever possible, define the types of variables.

### Module Conventions

- All modules should contain the following:

    `README.md`: A description of the module.
    `main.tf`: Module entrypoint where instantiation of resources happens.
    `variables.tf`: Module variables.
    `outputs.tf`: Output values (optional).
    `files/`: Any / all files required by the module.

- All module variables must have a description.
- Again, leverage community-maintained Terraform modules whenever possible.
- Avoid writing a module that is simply a wrapper of a Terraform resource unless absolutely necessary.

### Environment Conventions

- All environments should contain the following:

    `main.tf`: Toplevel terraform configuration file that instantiates the `environment` module.

- Configuration should be pushed "top->down" from the `environment` module to it's submodules.

### The Environment Module

- The `environment` module can be considered the top-level module, all other modules are imported from this module.
- Environment-specific variables should be exposed via the `variables.tf` file in this module, where they will be set from within the appropriate environment in the `environments/` directory.
- The `environment` module contains the following:

    `main.tf`: Module entrypoint where instantiation of resources happens.
    `backend.tf`: Terraform remote state configuration.
    `provider.tf`: Provider configuration.
    `variables.tf`: Environment-specific variables are desclared here.
    `versions.tf`: Terraform version information.
    `files/`: (DEPRECATED)

## AWS Guidelines

- TODO: Identity/Access Management (IAM) Guidelines

## Kubernetes Guidelines

- When to use the Terraform Kuberenetes Provider and when to use manifests?

    - Use the Terraform Kubernetes Provider (`provider "kubernetes"`) whenever you are provisioning a resource that could be considered relatively static (think Ingress, RoleBinding, CluterRoleBinding, etc).

    - Use conventional Kubernetes manifests / `kubectl` when provisioning resouirces that could be considered dynamic (think Deployments).

## Application

 1. Set up a profile for your project with your credentials in a specific profile in `~/.aws/credentials` and then export the following env var:
 `export AWS_PROFILE=<project_name>`

 2. Run the following from the appropriate environment directory under `environments/`:

 ```
 environment/development$ terraform init
 environment/development$ terraform plan
 ```
