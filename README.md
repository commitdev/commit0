## What is Zero

Zero is an open-source developer platform CLI tool which makes it quick and easy for technical founders & developers to build quality and reliable infrastructure to launch, grow and scale high-quality SaaS applications faster and more cost-effectively.


## Why is zero good for startups

As a technical founder or the first technical hire at a startup, your sole focus is to build the logic for your application, and get it into customers‚Äô hands as quickly and reliably as possible. Yet you immediately face multiple hurdles before even writing the first line of code. You‚Äôre forced to make many tech trade offs, leading to decision fatigue. You waste countless hours building boilerplate SaaS features not adding direct value to your customers. You spend precious time picking up unfamiliar tech, make wrong choices that result in costly refactoring or rebuilding in the future, and are unaware of tools and best practices that would speed up your product iteration.

## Why is zero reliable, scalable, performant and secure

Zero leverages Amazons‚Äô Elastic Kubernetes Service. EKS is amazon managed Kubernetes service where you can build and deploy your applications / containers. EKS is deeply integrated with other AWS services such as:

- [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud][vpc]
- [AWS Identity and Access Management][iam]
- [Amazon Cloud Watch][acw].
- [Auto Scaling Groups][asg].
- etc.

[AWS CLI], [Kubectl], [Terraform], [jq], [Git]

**Notes:**

1. **For Zero to communicate with your AWS account make sure you [authenticate AWS CLI with your account credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-methods)**

    - **You can also configure your aws cli during the zero porject initilization**


2. **You need to [register a new domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) / [host a registered domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html) you would like to use to host  your infrastructure on [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)**

      - **We recommended you have two domain names one for staging another from production**
